#My Great Task Manager

This Is a very simple, but yet still "great" task manager. It allows user authentication so that each user has their own editable list of tasks.
This project demonstrates the us of CRUD in the following ways:
                                                              Create: "Add New Task", allows the user to create a task with a title, priority and category via a form.
                                                              Read/Retrieve: "View all tasks" is a list of all the tasks the user entered into that database ordered by priority.
                                                              Update: The "Edit Task" function allows the user to edit their task or mark it as "completed" which then moves it to the "Completed Tasks" list.
                                                              Destroy: Under "Edit Task" the user can delete the task from their database.



I did not use any outside packages, but I did rely heavily on the Foobooks example code.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
